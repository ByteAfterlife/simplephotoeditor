# Quick note
I have realized that in the exe form, it takes a while to start the actual code, I am not sure why, so please be patient and do not press enter as that will trigger the "Not an image!" error
# Usage guide
## Basics
1: Download the .exe from the latest release
2: Run it and choose if you want to rotate or flip the image (you can do both)
3: To view the result, simply close the options menu (the one letting you rotate and flip) and you will be taken to the results page
## Saving your result
To save your result, press "View final result" (instructions to do so is in the Basics section) then save it from the image program you are using
