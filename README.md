# Usage guide
## Basics
1: Download the .exe from the latest release<br>
2: Run it and choose the image you want within the terminal of the program IT MUST BE AN ABSOLUTE PATH (aka no %userprofile% or that type of stuff)<br>
3: A GUI will be opened now (if you don't see it, check your taskbar), Choose what you want to do with the image (you can select as many options as you want)<br>
4: To view the result, simply close the options menu (the one letting you choose what to do) and you will see the results window. Press view final result on that window and you will see your new creation!
## Saving your result
To save your result, press "View final result" (instructions to do so is in the Basics section) then save it from the image program you are using
